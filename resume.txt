Current Personal Projects
    
       Deploying DockerNovember 2014
       
       Deployed a linux container platform that allows the automation of
       software applications on a local Computer Science House machine known
       as Hactar. Docker builds on top of a few different linux container 
       technologies, and we used it as a test platform for in-house written 
       applications. 
       
       

       AlgorithmicallyNovember 2014
       
       Implements several different common algorithms and data structures in 
       popular as well as new, cutting edge programming languages. Then running
       the unix time command and some nifty bash, it records the time each
       algorithm takes to run and stores the value. The values are then
       graphified and published online, using D3 javascript to graphify them.
       
       

       MyShellDecember 2014
       
       Wrote a basic unix shell in C that implements piping, standard I/O
       redirection and all commands found within the PATH variable as 
       well as a set of its own internal commands.
       
       

        Git by a TruckSeptember 2014https://github.com/ryansb/gitbyatruck
        

       
       It is a replacement for the tool known as "git by a bus" which scans
       through a repository and checks which developers commited to which file.
       "Git by a Truck" answers the question about a repository "if 20 of the
       developer team were to be hit by a bus, would the project survive?" The
       project is written using the Pyramid framework, a python web framework. 
       Using libgit for C bindings, and stored procedures that are triggered 
       on insert, we add information about a repository and process it. The
       front-end rest points are currently being written by me, as well as pretty D3
       javascript graphs.
       
    

Experience
	
        Earth MovesApril 2014 to August 2014Web Developer
        

		
        Worked on several applications per client request. My two main projects
        were building a web scraper to pull thousands of eye glass frames and
        aggregate them, from several websites, this was written using the Python
        library Scrapy and bootstrap CSS to display data. Then I built a web
        application for doctor's and hospitals to manage their operation trays,
        which was written in Python using the Pyramid Pylons framework and
        bootstrap CSS framework.

        Working on writing a web application that uses ArchivesSpace - a
        standard for museum websites, to display data about toy makers. It is
        meant to be displayed in a children's museum soon.
