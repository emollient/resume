Personal Projects
    
        AphroditeFebruary 2015https://github.com/emollient/Aphrodite
        
        A Haskell web app using the Scotty framework and Yesod's Template Haskell 
        that finds all the local Planned Parenthoods within an address/GPS location, and routes the user
        there via public transportation. It is aimed at low-income women without access to personal
        transportation.
        
        

       Git by a TruckSeptember 2014https://github.com/ryansb/gitbyatruck
       
       It is a replacement for the tool known as ``git by a bus" which scans
       through a repository and checks which developers commited to which file.
       ``Git by a Truck" answers the question about a repository ``if 20 of the
       developer team were to be hit by a bus, would the project survive?" The
       project is written using the Pyramid framework, a python web framework. 
       Using libgit for C bindings, and stored procedures that are triggered 
       on insert, we add information about a repository and process it. The
       front-end rest points are currently being written by me, as well as pretty D3
       javascript graphs.

        Developed a micro-benchmarker that produced statistics and graphs for provided executables
        and their corresponding arguments. Written with a python script with output piped into
        a graph generating R script, it produced box-and-whisker plots as well as outputting ANOVA and
        T-tests for the supplied executables.
