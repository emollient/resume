Summary
    
    I'm incredibly passionate about Free Open Source Software and Women in Computing. These are both issues I hold near and dear
    and try my hardest to contribute to each of their respective communities. When time permits, I am contributing to open source 
    projects such as Fedora as well as volunteering for the local chapter of Girl Develop It as a teacher/TA. I've also come to 
    realize that most of my learning, especially in the Computer Science field, must be done outside of the classroom setting. As
    such, I spend much of my free time working on personal projects and have subsequently been able to pick up new things relatively
    quickly.

Personal Projects
    
        Git by a TruckSeptember 2014https://github.com/ryansb/gitbyatruck
       
       Working on this with Ryan Brown, it is a replacement for the tool known as "git by a bus" which scans through a repository and checks which developers commited to which file. "Git by a Truck" answers the question about a repository "if 20 of the developer team were to be hit by a bus, would the project survive?" I am currently implementing the front end to display the rest points.

Then I built a web application for doctor's and hospitals to manage their operation trays, which was written in Python using the Pyramid Pylons framework and bootstrap CSS framework.
