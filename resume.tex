\section{\mysidestyle Personal Projects}
    \begin{asparadesc}
        \rproject{Aphrodite}{February 2015}{}{https://github.com/emollient/Aphrodite}
        \small
        A {\bf Haskell} web app using the {\bf Scotty framework} and {\bf Yesod's Template Haskell} 
        that finds all the local Planned Parenthoods within an address/GPS location, and routes the user
        there via public transportation. It is aimed at low-income women without access to personal
        transportation.

       \rproject{Git by a Truck}{September 2014}{}{https://github.com/ryansb/gitbyatruck}
       \small
       It is a replacement for the tool known as ``git by a bus" which scans
       through a repository and checks which developers commited to which file.
       ``Git by a Truck" answers the question about a {\bf repository} ``if 20\% of the
       developer team were to be hit by a bus, would the project survive?" The
       project is written using the {\bf Pyramid framework}, a python web framework. 
       Using {\bf libgit for C bindings}, and {\bf stored procedures} that are triggered 
       on insert, we add information about a repository and process it. The
       front-end rest points are currently being written by me, as well as pretty {\bf D3
       javascript graphs}.

\section{\mysidestyle Experience}
	\begin{asparadesc}
        \rproject{LinkedIn}{June 2015 to Present}{Systems Engineer Intern}{https://www.linkedin.com/}
        \\
        \small
        Worked to make logs from {\bf CF Engine} humanly readible. Built thousands of servers and helped {\bf automate}
        the process which enabled them to be built more effectively. Helped LinkedIn finzalize which {\bf container 
        solution} to continue on with.
        \normalsize
        \\
        \rproject{Golisano College of Computing and Informational Sciences}{January 2015 to May 2015}{Research Assistant}{http://www.mlton.org/} 
        \\
        \small
        Developed a micro-benchmarker that produced statistics and graphs for provided executables
        and their corresponding arguments. Written with a {\bf python script} with output piped into
        a graph generating {\bf R script}, it produced box-and-whisker plots as well as outputting ANOVA and
        T-tests for the supplied executables.

        \rproject{Media Arts Games Interaction and Creativity Center at RIT}{August 2014 to January 2015}{Back-end Web Developer}{http://magic.rit.edu/main/index.html}
		\small
        \\
        Worked on writing a web application that uses {\bf ArchivesSpace} - a
        standard for museum websites, to display data about toy makers.\normalsize
        \\
        \rproject{Earth Moves}{April 2014 to August 2014}{Fullstack Web Developer}{}
        \\
		\small
        Worked on several applications per client request. My two main projects
        were building a {\bf web scraper} to pull thousands of eye glass frames and
        aggregate them, from several websites, this was written using the {\bf Python
        library Scrapy}and {\bf Bootstrap CSS} to display data.
