\section{\mysidestyle Current Personal Projects}
    \begin{asparadesc}
        \rproject{Deploying Docker}{November 2014}{}{https://www.docker.com/}
       \small
       Deployed a {\bf linux container} platform that allows the {\bf automation of
       software} applications on a local Computer Science House machine known
       as Hactar. Docker builds on top of a few different linux container 
       technologies, and we used it as a {\bf test platform} for in-house written 
       applications.

       \\
       \rproject{Algorithmically}{November 2014}{}{https://github.com/emollient/Algorithmically}
       \small 
       Implements several different {\bf common algorithms} and {\bf data structures} in 
       popular as well as new, cutting edge programming languages. Then running
       the {\bf unix} time command and some nifty bash, it records the time each
       algorithm takes to run and stores the value. The values are then
       graphified and published online, using {\bf D3 javascript} to graphify them.
       \normalsize
       \\
       \rproject{MyShell}{December 2014}{}{}
       \small
       Wrote a basic {\bf unix shell} in C that implements {\bf piping}, {\bf standard I/O
       redirection} and all commands found within the {\bf PATH variable} as 
       well as a set of its own internal commands.
       \normalsize
       \\
       \rproject{Git by a Truck}{September 2014}{}{https://github.com/ryansb/gitbyatruck}
       \small
       It is a replacement for the tool known as ``git by a bus" which scans
       through a repository and checks which developers commited to which file.
       ``Git by a Truck" answers the question about a {\bf repository} ``if 20\% of the
       developer team were to be hit by a bus, would the project survive?" The
       project is written using the {\bf Pyramid framework}, a python web framework. 
       Using {\bf libgit for C bindings}, and {\bf stored procedures} that are triggered 
       on insert, we add information about a repository and process it. The
       front-end rest points are currently being written by me, as well as pretty {\bf D3
       javascript graphs}.

\section{\mysidestyle Experience}
	\begin{asparadesc}
        \rproject{Earth Moves}{April 2014 to August 2014}{Fullstack Web Developer}{}
        \\
		\small
        Worked on several applications per client request. My two main projects
        were building a {\bf web scraper} to pull thousands of eye glass frames and
        aggregate them, from several websites, this was written using the {\bf Python
        library Scrapy}and {\bf Bootstrap CSS} to display data. Then I built a {\bf web
        application} for doctor's and hospitals to manage their operation trays,
        which was written in Python using the {\bf Pyramid Pylons framework} and
        {\bf Bootstrap CSS framework}. \normalsize

        \rproject{Media Arts Games Interaction and Creativity Center at RIT}{August 2014 to Present}{Back-end Web Developer}{http://magic.rit.edu/main/index.html}
        \\
		\small
        Working on writing a web application that uses {\bf ArchivesSpace} - a
        standard for museum websites, to display data about toy makers. It is
        meant to be displayed in a children's museum soon. \end{asparadesc}
